## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    32-bit identity of a machine on the internet

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    Domain Name Service. Easier for humans to read and remember.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP's won't change once assigned to a device. Dynamic IP's are requested by a device and hence can change.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    UDP needs no confirmation, faster and great for video calls. TCP is connection-based, can ensure data is not lost.

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is event based. Delays are not needed/in the way of a trigger.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    While the fuction is exceuting, the processor and the port are unable to focus on another task.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    A trigger event can be created that will occupy the processor only when a port needs attention.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface defines how function will be called. Implementation is what the function will do to accomplish the task.
   The two can be seperated so that the same functions can be called different ways by different systems or to call functions
   the same way but get tasks done in a different manner.
